Arrays :-

Linear collection of same type of elements that are stored together in contiguous memory spaces.

index will always start form 0.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int marks1 = 99;❌
    int marks2 = 78;❌
    int marks3 = 62;❌

    int marks[] = {99, 78, 62}✔️  [a] is the size of arrays

    marks[0] =  99;
    marks[1] =  78;
    marks[2] =  62;

    sizeof(marks) = 12 

    sizeof(marks)/sizeof(int) = 3;


    return 0;
}


Memory is statically allocted (at compile time)

Name of arrays is pointer
